# PA9 - Chess in SFML with Sockets
Teammate names - Cole Godfrey, Cal Tatualla
Lab Section (both) - 5
Demo + Explanation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UkIB4_gYk

## Instructions
Fairly simple, start application, after test cases it will bring you to main menu. You can choose a single game, or a game with sockets.

### FOR SOCKETS
After clicking play with sockets, you will then be asked in that application if you want to host or join (H/J). One application must host , one join. After this, you should get 2 separate screens of chess representing each player. Host starts first, after they make a move you should see that move on the other client's application.

### Other notes
YOU MUST BUILD THIS IN RELEASE!!!\n\n
Also sometimes there is a linker issue with it compiling the test constructor twice, simply rebuild solution and it should go away.

## Acknowledgements
Chess pieces from wikipedia, sfml documentation and discussion boards responsible for much of the sockets implementation, geeks4geeks provided many helpful snippets of code.
